        <h4>Module Overview</h4>

        <p>Since Texas Senate Bill 407 passed in 2011, the legal consequences regarding sexting have been expanded; therefore, it is important for everyone – especially minors – to become aware of the penalties that can come from being convicted of sexting.</p>

        <h4>What is Texas Senate Bill 407?</h4>

        <p>Before Texas Senate Bill 407 (SB 407) was passed, minors who engaged in sexting could only be charged with promotion or possession of child pornography, which, if convicted, carries a felony offense and lifelong registry as a sex offender – both extremely serious penalties. SB 407 now provides courts less extreme charges and penalties that still discourage the practice of sexting without the life-altering consequences of a felony conviction and sex offender status.</p>

        <p>In general, you are illegally engaging in sexting if you – knowingly or on purpose – send, show or keep a picture or video of a minor – including yourself – engaging in "sexual conduct".</p>

        <hr>

        <h4>What is the difference between "promotion" and "possession" of electronic material?</h4>

        <p>Technically, the law uses the terms "promotion" and "possession" when referring to sending and keeping illegal "visual material". While "possession" simply means keeping a picture or video, the term "promotion", according to the law, also means manufacture, sell, give, lend, transmit, publish, distribute, present, or exhibit.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Promotion:</strong> to transfer, transmit, publish, distribute, circulate, disseminate, present, exhibit, or advertise sexually-explicit or sexually-suggestive images or video via mobile device or computer</li>
          <li><strong>Possession:</strong> having in one’s control, material that depicts another minor engaging in sexual conduct that has not been destroyed in a reasonable amount of time</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h4>What are the misdemeanor conditions and penalties for sexting?</h4>

        <p><strong>Class C misdemeanor:</strong> A fine of up to $500.00.</p>

        <p>You can be charged with a Class C Misdemeanor for sexting promotion or possession if you are a minor, and it is a first-time offense.</p>

        <p><strong>Class B misdemeanor:</strong> A fine up to $2,000.00, 180 days in jail, or both.</p>

        <p>You can be charged with a Class B Misdemeanor for sexting if you are a minor and you:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Promoted an illegal picture or video with intent to harass, annoy, alarm, abuse, torment, embarrass, or offend someone</li>
          <li>Have previously been convicted for sexting</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Class A misdemeanor:</strong> A fine up to $4,000.00, one year in jail, or both.</p>

        <p>You can be charged with a Class A Misdemeanor for sexting if you are a minor and you:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Have previously been convicted one or more times of promoting an illegal picture or video with intent to harass, annoy, alarm, abuse, torment, embarrass, or offend someone</li>
          <li>Have previously been convicted for general sexting promotion or possession two or more times</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h4>What are the felony conditions and penalties for sexting?</h4>

        <p><strong>Third degree felony:</strong> A fine not to exceed $10,000.00 and at least two years in jail, but no more than 10 years – equal to a late model car or truck and not being able to see friends, family, or even go to school for two years. By the time you got out of jail some of your friends may have already graduated from high school. Worst of all, you can be mandated to register as a sex offender for the rest of your life.</p>

        <p>You can be charged with a third degree felony for sexting promotion or possession as either a minor or an adult.</p>

        <p><strong>Consider this:</strong> It’s completely possible that as an 18 year old high school senior, you could be charged and convicted of possession and/or promotion of child pornography if the person you're dating is under 18 years old, sends you such images, and you consider showing or sending them to other people.</p>

        <hr>

        <h4>What is the Education Program for Sexting Prevention?</h4>

        <p>In place of, or in addition to a fine or jail time, a minor may be required by a judge to take and pass an educational program regarding sexting. This program is approved for judicial purposes, upon successful completion of the assessment that follows this program.</p>

        <hr>

        <h4>What is the difference between being charged for sexting as a child or as a minor?</h4>

        <p>If you are under the age of 18 and are charged with a Class A, B, or C misdemeanor, the consequences can range from probation to fines and/or jail time. Juvenile probation and adult probation both give you the opportunity to reflect and learn from your mistakes, but should you fail to uphold your assigned responsibilities as detailed in your terms of probation, your sanctions can become more severe. In the state of Texas, a “child” is defined as a person ten years old or older and under 17 years of age. A 17 year old is not considered a <strong>child</strong> but in most cases is still considered a "minor" and not yet an adult. So, if a child in Texas is charged with sexting, s/he will most likely be dealt with in juvenile court. If found guilty, the child will have engaged in <strong>Conduct Indicating a Need for Supervision (CINS)</strong>, and be subject to Sanction Level I or II penalties.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>At <strong>Sanction Level I</strong>, a juvenile court or probation department may:
            <ul>
              <li>require counseling for the child regarding the child's conduct</li>
              <li>inform the child of the progressive sanctions that may be imposed on the child if the child continues to engage in delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision</li>
              <li>inform the child's parents or guardians of their responsibility to impose reasonable restrictions on the child to prevent the conduct from recurring</li>
              <li>provide information or other assistance to the child or the child's parents or guardians in securing needed social services</li>
              <li>require the child or the child's parents or guardians to participate in Early Youth Intervention Services, if available to the child or the child's parents or guardians</li>
              <li>refer the child to a community-based citizen intervention program approved by the juvenile court</li>
              <li>release the child to the child's parents or guardians</li>
              <li>require the child to attend and successfully complete a sexting prevention educational program, or another equivalent educational program.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>At <strong>Sanction Level II</strong>, a juvenile court or probation department may:
            <ul>
              <li>Issue deferred adjudication for not less than three months or more than six months</li>
              <li>Require the child to make restitution to the victim of the child’s conduct or to perform community service</li>
              <li>Require the child’s parents or guardians to identify restrictions the parents or guardians will impose on the child’s activities and requirements they will set for the child's behavior</li>
              <li>Require the attendance and successful completion of a sexting prevention educational program</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>If a 17 year old <strong>minor</strong> in Texas is charged with sexting, the case will likely be handled by a justice, municipal, or county court. If found guilty, it is possible for a 17 year old minor to receive probation as part of deferred adjudication.</p>

        <p>Should a child or minor successfully fulfill his/her terms of probation, it is possible to apply for the conviction to be removed from his/her record. Therefore, the justice system – especially for juveniles – gives people the opportunity to make up and learn from their mistakes, start over with a clean slate, and participate as safe and responsible citizens.</p>

        <h4>What can you do if you receive sexting material you didn’t ask for?</h4>

        <p>So, what happens if someone sends you sexting material that you didn’t ask for? What are your options? You may want to protect the person that sent it to you from any embarrassment or humiliation that might come from the picture or video getting into the wrong hands and decide to tell an adult. But what if you just want to delete it? Would it be considered destruction of evidence if you delete it and don’t tell anyone?</p>

        <p>If you want to "Just Delete It!":</p>

        <ol>
          <li>You must not have created or asked for the material</li>
          <li>You must only have it because another minor sent it to you</li>
          <li>You must have deleted it within a reasonable amount of time based on when you received it</li>
          <li>You must be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the above is true</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>It is still possible for you to be charged with possession of sexting material even if you delete it, but you are protected under the new law as long as you can prove the first three things listed above.</strong></p>
