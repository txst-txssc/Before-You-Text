        <h4>What is sexting?</h4>

        <p><strong>Sexting</strong> is the act of sending sexually explicit messages, photographs, or videos primarily between mobile phones— Texas law also includes any "electronic means," which includes computers and other digital devices. The term was first popularized in early 21st century, and combines the words "sex" with "texting."" Texas law defines sexting by minors as illegal if a minor:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"intentionally or knowingly by electronic means promotes to another minor visual material depicting a minor, including the actor (the person who sent it), engaging in sexual conduct, if the actor produced the visual material or knows that another minor produced the visual material; or possesses in an electronic format visual material depicting another minor engaging in sexual conduct, if the actor produced the visual material or knows that another minor produced the visual material."</p>
          <small>Section 43.261, Texas Penal Code</small>
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Examples of Sexting</h4>

        <p>You are at a party with a group of friends. They suggest taking pictures of each other without clothes and sending them to one another would liven up the party.</p>

        <p>During exam week you are too busy to see your boyfriend/girlfriend in person but want them to know that you are thinking of him/her. You decide to email him/her several photos you took of yourself in front of a mirror trying to look sexy.</p>

        <p>Your ex-boyfriend/girlfriend forwards a photo of you without any clothes on to a close friend of theirs who promises not to share it with anyone else.</p>

        <p>While you are in class, a boy/girl you do not know very well sends you a text message describing sexual activities they would like to engage in with you.</p>

        <h4>What is bullying?</h4>

        <p>According to <a href="http://stopbullying.gov/topics/what_is_bullying/index.html">StopBullying.gov</a>, bullying involves:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Imbalance of Power</strong>: people who bully use their power to control or harm; the people being bullied may have a hard time defending themselves</li>
          <li><strong>Intent to Cause Harm</strong>: actions done by accident are not bullying; the person bullying has a goal to cause harm</li>
          <li><strong>Repetition</strong>: incidents of bullying happen to the same person over and over by the same person or group</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Under Texas House Bill 1942 (HB 1942), bullying is defined as "engaging in written, verbal or electronic expression or physical conduct that occurs on school property, in a school vehicle, or at a school- sponsored activity" that results in the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Has or will have the effect of physically harming a student</li>
          <li>Damaging property or placing a student in reasonable fear of harm to person or property</li>
          <li>Is sufficiently severe, persistent, and pervasive enough to create an intimidating, threatening, or abusive environment</li>
        </ul>

        <p>According to the law (HB 1942), conduct defined as bullying is considered bullying if the conduct:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Exploits an imbalance of power between the bully and the victim in written or verbal expression or physical conduct</li>
          <li>Interferes with a student’s education or substantially disrupts the operation of school</li>
